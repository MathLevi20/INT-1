            <p> comes from within. Do not seek it without. This, too, will pass. Peace comes
            from within. Do not seek it without. If the facts don't fit the theory, change the facts.
            You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger. The
            smaller your reality, the more convinced you are that you know everything. The
            past has no power over the present moment. If the facts don't fit the theory, change
            the facts.
            You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger.</p>
